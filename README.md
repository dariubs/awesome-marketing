# awesome-marketing

A living document of hand-picked resources for marketers (or, I bookmark too many things to read and forget which folder they're in).

üöß Very much still a work in progress üöß

I also have another list of [awesome-developer-marketing](https://github.com/ronakganatra/awesome-developer-marketing) resources.

Why am I turning my bookmarks into a public repo? The problem with marketing related content online is that it's 99% crap and fluff. I try to read a lot and save my resources. So I thought I might as well make it public, so you can save yourself some time trying to find things worth reading.
